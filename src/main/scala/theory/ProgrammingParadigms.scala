  / OO ortogonal to all of them, can be combined with all
  Imperative: modigy mutable variables using assingmenst and control structures, loops, break, continue, return
  Based in Von Newman...
  mutable vars --- memory cells,
  variable dereferences (getting the value stored in memory location pointed by pointer --- load instructions,
  variable assingmets--- store isntructions,
  control strunctures --- jumps
  problem: scaling up, avoid conceptualize programs word by word, need of High level abstractions such as collections,
  shapes, strings, documents, ideally by theories:
  theory -- one or more data types, operation on the types, laws describing the relationships....

  but there is no place for mutation, get new ways

  restricted FP ... no mutation at all... Pure Lisp, Haskel without I/O monad, Xpath, Scheme
  wider sense ... just concentrate in functions... Scala, Ruby, F#, Clojure, Lisp, Haskell

  Every non trivial programming lang:
    primitive expressions represent the simplest elements
    ways to combine expressions
    ways to abstract expressions, which introduce a name for an expression by which it can be referred to


    REPL Read Eval Print Loop
    sbt console

    Evaluation, take de leftmost operator, evaluate its operand (left before right), apply the operator to the operands
    name evaluated by replacing with right hand side of definition

   eval process stops once it results in a value (number, function,...
